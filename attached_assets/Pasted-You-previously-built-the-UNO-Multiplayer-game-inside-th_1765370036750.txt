You previously built the UNO Multiplayer game inside the QRFun platform.
Now extend QRFun by adding a new feature to UNO only:

⭐ UNO  STREAMING MODE

This must be added cleanly, modularly, and without modifying or breaking any existing UNO code, logic, UI, or behavior.
Current UNO Normal Mode must continue functioning exactly as it does today.

All Streaming Mode features must be additive, leaving existing UNO untouched.

=========================
⭐ PART 1 — ROOM CREATION MODIFICATION
=========================

UNO must now support two different room creation flows, depending on whether the creator is a Normal User or a Guru User.

🔷 1. NORMAL USER ROOM CREATION — “Advanced” Checkbox

When a normal user creates a UNO room:

Display:

Nickname input (as already implemented)

A small label: “Advanced”, with a checkbox next to it.

✔ If the checkbox is NOT checked

→ Create a regular UNO room (Normal Mode)
→ Use existing UNO pages and logic exactly as they are
→ No Streaming Mode active

✔ If the checkbox IS checked

Before activating Streaming Mode, show a confirmation dialog:

“Warning: Streaming Mode changes room behavior and requires special setup.
If you are not sure how this feature works, please uncheck Advanced Mode.”

If user confirms → enable Streaming Mode.
If user cancels → uncheck the box and default to Normal Mode.

🔷 2. GURU USER ROOM CREATION — Two Tabs

When a Guru User logs in and creates a UNO room:

Show two large, clear tabs:

Normal Mode

Streaming Mode

✔ Normal Mode Tab

Behaves exactly like current UNO.
Use all existing pages and logic unchanged.

✔ Streaming Mode Tab

Enables the special Streaming Mode behavior defined below.

=========================
⭐ PART 2 — STREAMING MODE BEHAVIOR
=========================

Streaming Mode is a separate game flow designed for content creators, streamers, and Guru Users, while ensuring that:

✔ Players experience a normal UNO game
✔ The Stream Page does NOT reveal any hidden cards
✔ Existing UNO logic remains untouched

Streaming Mode does not affect gameplay rules — only the visibility and room entry logic.

⭐ A. FIRST PAGE = STREAM PAGE (NO HOST CONNECTED)

When Streaming Mode is selected:

Immediately create the UNO room

Load the waiting lobby

Make it appear that no host is connected

All player slots appear empty

The first-rendered page becomes the STREAM PAGE

The creator (Normal or Guru) is NOT automatically joined as host.

This page is intended for:

Live streaming

OBS

TikTok Live

YouTube Live

Display systems

⭐ B. HOST MUST JOIN MANUALLY

After room creation in Streaming Mode, the creator must rejoin through:

Invite link

QR code scan

QR code upload

Manual room code entry

Host assignment rule:

The first authenticated joiner becomes host

If Guru logs in → Guru becomes host

If Normal User joins → they become host

All other players who joined after first joiner which is the host should be listed in the spectator table.

Host only  will be choosing who will play and assighn them to slots
Host will be able to edit there nick names in the spectator table before choosing them.

all spectator users will be transfared to the viewer table when the game starts.

only nicknames that are availbe will show any user with no network connectivity will be removed automaticly.

⭐ C. TWO PAGE TYPES MUST EXIST

Streaming Mode produces two different client experiences.

⭐ 1. STREAM PAGE (Public View)

This is the FIRST page created automatically.

It must:

Show UNO table normally

Show turn indicator

Show player nicknames

Show all player card decks as hidden (card back only)

NEVER show:

Player cards

Bot indicators

Guru indicators

Host controls

Be read-only

This page continues updating in real time via WebSockets.

⭐ 2. HOST / GURU PAGE (Private View)

When the creator joins the room:

They load the standard UNO gameplay page

This page must work EXACTLY like current UNO

All original UNO controls must remain unchanged:

Start Game

Kick player

Promote viewer

Restart game

Play cards

Draw cards

Select colors, etc.

Visibility rules:

Guru User sees ALL player cards

Normal host sees only their own hand (unchanged)

Normal players see only their own cards

Stream page must continue showing hidden cards only

=========================
⭐ PART 3 — PLAYER EXPERIENCE
=========================
✔ Normal players see:

Only their own cards

No indication that Streaming Mode is active

No exposure to Guru features

✔ Viewers see:

Board

Nicknames

Turn info

Hidden cards only

No control elements

✔ Bots (if used) behave normally

No change in existing bot logic.

=========================
⭐ PART 4 — GURU USER BEHAVIOR
=========================

Streaming Mode does NOT change existing Guru behavior.

If Guru hosts:

Guru page shows all player cards

Stream page hides all cards

Normal players remain unaffected

Guru labels must NEVER appear in UI

=========================
⭐ PART 5 — DO NOT BREAK EXISTING UNO SYSTEM
=========================

The following must remain untouched:

All existing UNO pages

All UNO card logic

All turn/stacking rules

All draw, skip, reverse, and action card mechanics

All host controls

All viewer logic

All WebSocket events

All lobby flows

All existing UI layouts

All UNO game files

Streaming Mode must be fully independent and additive.

=========================
⭐ FINAL REQUIREMENT
=========================

IMPORTANT:
Normal UNO Mode must continue operating EXACTLY as it does today.
Do NOT modify or delete any current logic or UI.
Streaming Mode must be implemented as an optional layer that activates ONLY when selected.

Deliver:

Full UNO Streaming Mode feature

Two creation flows (Normal User & Guru User)

Stream Page + Host/Guru Page separation

Full compatibility with current UNO logic

Production-ready code
