Everything in Viewer Mode and the gameplay logic is working correctly.
Now I want you to apply UI-only fixes, without modifying any game rules, socket logic, card logic, flow, or any other behavior.

Important: Do NOT change anything except the items below.
1. CENTER THE 4-PLAYER GAMEPLAY AREA

During gameplay (after the host starts the game), the UI for the 4 active players should always be centered on the screen, regardless of:

Phone layout

Tablet layout

Desktop layout

Orientation

This means:

The 4-player board (top player, left player, right player, bottom player) must be wrapped in a responsive container that forces it to stay centered both horizontally and vertically inside the page.

This must apply identically in Viewer Mode AND in the normal player gameplay view.

DO NOT modify card sizes, avatars, or layout logic — only center the entire gameplay block so UI does not overlap on different devices.

Use responsive flex or grid, but do not break existing sizes.

2. REMOVE THE TOP-CENTER TURN NOTIFICATION

Currently there are two turn indicators:

The top-center floating turn notification

The turn indicator on the player’s card/deck area

I want to remove the top-center turn notification completely.

Do NOT remove or modify any turn logic — only remove the UI element.

Instead:

Make the turn indicator on top of the player’s deck “shine” or animate exactly like the old top-center notification did.

Use the same glow/pulse animation (or the same CSS class) that was previously used for the top notification.

Do NOT change the player deck layout. Only add the animation.

3. ADD A TOGGLE BUTTON TO HIDE/SHOW THE VIEWER TABLE

Inside Viewer Mode gameplay:

Add a small button (example: “Hide Viewers / Show Viewers”)

When pressed, it toggles the viewer table visibility (display: none / block)

Requirements:

Default state: Viewer table visible (unchanged)

Size, position, and layout of the viewer table must remain exactly the same

Do NOT shrink it

Do NOT move it

Do NOT restyle it

Just allow it to be hidden or shown

Button can be small and placed in a corner or top-right of the viewer table area

Do not affect any viewer logic — only visual toggle.

4. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE

Avoid modifying:

Game logic

Turn handling

Socket behavior

Card flows

Animations (except the turn highlight)

Player slot logic

Viewer logic

Host authority logic

Guro mode

Normal mode

Stream mode

Make the smallest UI changes required to achieve the three items above.

Summary of Required Changes

Center the full 4-player gameplay UI on all devices (responsive container).

Remove the top-center turn notification.

Make the turn indicator above the player deck shine just like the old top one did.

Add a hide/show toggle for the viewer table, without changing size or position.

Do NOT modify any gameplay logic or existing sizes/layout of other components.
