I want to update the Viewer Mode lobby creation flow, but I do NOT want to change any game logic, rules, UI, or socket behavior during gameplay. Viewer Mode gameplay must remain exactly the same once the game starts. Only the pre-game lobby flow should change.

Below are the exact requirements:

1. Viewer Mode: Room Creation Flow Changes

When Viewer Mode creates a room:

Do NOT ask for a nickname when the room is created.

The lobby must open empty:

No players in any slot

No players listed in the viewer table

The host is NOT assigned at room creation time.

The room should show the lobby UI but with no host and no players yet.

2. Join Flow for Viewer Mode

All players (including the future host) must join the room using:

Link

QR code

Game code

When someone joins Viewer Mode:

They must enter a nickname at this step (not at room creation).

The first player to join becomes the host and is automatically placed into slot 1.

This first player must be redirected to the host page (the same page the host normally sees).

All other joining players:

Appear in the viewer table

They cannot click to join slots

They all see the same lobby page layout, same as other viewers

This means:

No one except the host can join slots during the lobby

Host will later place players in slots (after the game starts, normal join/kick behavior must stay unchanged)

3. Lobby Page Behavior (Before Game Starts)

All players (including the host) must see:

The same lobby page UI

Same player list

Same viewer table

BUT viewer users do NOT have slot selection buttons

Only the host sees the Start Game button

Only the host can later move players into slots after game begins (normal logic stays)

This ensures identical lobby display for all except host authority.

4. When the Host Starts the Game

When the host presses Start Game:

Gameplay must switch to the existing Viewer Mode gameplay UI, but:

The viewers get the full board view WITHOUT their own card deck at the bottom

The 4 active players get their normal hands visible to themselves only

This behavior is already implemented in Viewer Mode; do NOT modify game logic.

IMPORTANT:

Once the game starts:

All existing features must work exactly the same as before, including:

Kick

Replace player with viewer

Rejoin logic

Same cards for reconnecting players

New players joining after start get new cards

Game pause logic

Voting system for host leave

Notifications

Stream updates

All game rules, penalties, turn logic

UI layout for active players

Do NOT modify any of the above.

5. Summary of Required Behavior Changes

Modify ONLY the pre-game lobby workflow in Viewer Mode:

A) Room creation:

No nickname input

Empty lobby

No players assigned

B) First user to join:

Enters nickname

Becomes host automatically

Automatically assigned to slot 1

Redirected to host lobby page

C) Other users:

Enter nickname

Appear in viewer table

Cannot click to join slots

See same lobby layout as others

D) Game start:

Host presses Start

Viewer Mode gameplay begins with ZERO changes to existing game logic

6. DO NOT CHANGE ANY EXISTING LOGIC OUTSIDE THE LOBBY FLOW

Do NOT modify the UNO rules

Do NOT modify game logic

Do NOT modify socket messages

Do NOT modify the card deck

Do NOT modify penalties, kicks, joins

Do NOT modify host logic during gameplay

Do NOT modify any of the Guro/Normal/Stream modes

Do NOT modify any event flows after Start Game

ONLY change the lobby flow as specified above.
