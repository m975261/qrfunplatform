Build a full-stack multiplayer UNO-style card game with the following features:

🃏 Game Logic:
1. It should be a **classic UNO game** with standard rules:
   - Match cards by color or number
   - Include all action cards: Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, Draw Four
   - Turn-based logic with direction control (clockwise or counterclockwise)
2. Maximum **4 players** per room
3. Game state should be **synchronized in real time** using `socket.io`
4. If the game has **already started**, new users **cannot join** as players but can join as **spectators**

👥 Authentication & Access:
1. No account or sign-up is required
2. On entering the game, ask the user only for a **nickname**
3. Players can **join existing game rooms** in any of the following ways:
   - By entering a room code
   - By uploading a QR code image that contains the room link or token
   - By scanning a QR code with their phone and opening the embedded link
4. Players can **create a new game room** from the main page

🏠 Room & Player Behavior:
1. If the player **joins a room before the game has started**:
   - Show the full room with **4 player slots**
   - Allow the player to click an **empty slot** to join the game
2. If the player joins **after the game has started**:
   - Enter the room as a **spectator**
   - Allow spectators to **watch the game in real-time**
   - Spectators can only **send animated emojis**, but **not interact with gameplay**
3. The **host (room creator)** can:
   - See who joined
   - **Kick/remove** any player before the game starts
   - Click "Start Game" to begin the match

🎨 UI Layout:
1. Match the layout of a typical UNO game:
   - Center area with the current card pile and direction indicator
   - Four player areas (top, bottom, left, right) showing cards and avatars
   - The user sees their own hand (actual cards), but other players' hands only show card backs
2. Each player area should show:
   - Nickname
   - Avatar (default image or emoji)
3. Include chat/emojis panel for interaction
4. Add a timer display if a player's turn is delayed
5. Create a lobby/home screen to:
   - Enter nickname
   - Create or join a room
   - Upload or scan a QR code

⚙️ Tech Stack Suggestions (optional):
- Frontend: HTML + CSS or Tailwind + Vanilla JS or React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Real-time: `socket.io`
- QR code: `qrcode` + `jsonwebtoken` (for token-based room links)
- Database (optional): Replit DB or Supabase for storing rooms & player states

🎯 Deployment:
- Game should be hosted and playable directly from Replit with live multiplayer functionality.

Please generate all necessary files (frontend, backend, and socket logic) to run the game fully on Replit.
