You previously built the UNO Multiplayer game inside the QRFun platform, which was designed to support multiple games.
The QRFun main menu already includes an “XO (Coming Soon)” entry.
Now build XO Multiplayer as the second game inside the QRFun platform.

XO must be implemented on top of the existing QRFun architecture, reusing all systems already built for UNO Multiplayer whenever possible—without breaking UNO or duplicating functionality.

Follow the same structural patterns, WebSocket architecture, user entry system, QR joining logic, admin system, and UI framework that QRFun already uses for UNO.

=========================
IMPORTANT PLATFORM INTEGRATION RULES
=========================
✔ XO becomes Game #2 on QRFun

Integrate it into the existing QRFun main menu.

Replace the “XO (Coming Soon)” tile with the new XO game.

✔ Do NOT modify UNO gameplay or break its logic.
✔ DO reuse what is already built for QRFun:

Room creation & join system

QR code generate/scan/upload system

Nickname-based user entry

Host & viewer logic

WebSocket structure

Admin panel

2FA authentication (Google Authenticator)

Email password reset

Session/token system

UI layout framework

Lobby flow

Game routing system

✔ DO keep XO logic modular & isolated to avoid interfering with UNO.
=========================
XO GAME RULES & LOGIC
=========================
Board Progression System

Start at 3×3, win = 3-in-a-row

Draw → 4×4, win = 3-in-a-row

Draw → 5×5, win = 4-in-a-row

Draw → 6×6, win = 5-in-a-row

Draw on 6×6 → start new 6×6 and alternate first turn

Turn & Gameplay

Exactly 2 active players

Unlimited spectators

Always display: “Win Condition: {N}-in-a-row.”

Game pauses if a player disconnects (NO AI takeover)

Game Over

Show simple win screen (Play Again / Go Home)

=============================
AI SYSTEM (NORMAL + PERFECT MODE)
=============================

XO must support two AI types.

🔹 1. Normal Bot Mode

Used when a regular player selects Play With Bot.

Easy, Medium, Hard = normal behavior

If the player selects Hardest difficulty, activate Perfect Mode AI

🔹 2. Perfect Mode AI (Must-Win AI)

This AI MUST activate in ONLY TWO situations:

A. Guru User logs in and becomes a player

Perfect Mode AI takes over the Guru User seat

MUST ignore difficulty settings

MUST try to win

Plays invisibly (nickname only)

B. Normal user chooses the “Hardest” difficulty in Bot Mode

Perfect Mode AI replaces normal bot logic

MUST try to win

AI Algorithms

3×3 and 4×4 → strong Minimax

5×5 and 6×6 → MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)

No neural networks or training required

=============================
AI INVISIBILITY RULE
=============================

In XO gameplay UI:

Never display “Bot”, “AI”, “Perfect Mode”, “Guru User”, or any tag.
Only show player nicknames.
The AI must remain invisible.

Nicknames must be the only identities visible to players and spectators.

=============================
USER SYSTEM (NORMAL + GURU)
=============================
Normal Users

Join QRFun XO rooms with a nickname

No login required

Can edit nickname anytime

Guru Users

Created in the Admin Panel.

Store:

username (private, never shown)

password

email

nickname (this is the public name)

Guru Login Rules

Login requires username + password + Google Authenticator 2FA

Public nickname displays in game

If Guru becomes a player → Perfect Mode AI plays AS them

Guru vs Bot

If Guru User chooses Play with Bot, Perfect Mode AI must activate and attempt to win.

=============================
ADMIN PANEL EXTENSION
=============================

Extend the existing QRFun Admin Panel (do not replace it).

Add Guru User Management

Create Guru Users (username, password, email, nickname)

Edit Guru Users

Delete Guru Users

Reset Guru password via email

Admin password reset also via email

Admin panel security:

Username + password

2FA (Google Authenticator)

=============================
LOGIN & ACCESS (QR + CODE)
=============================

XO must use the same login/join options as UNO, but adapted:

Supported Methods

Enter nickname

Enter room code

Scan QR code

Upload QR image

Click invitation link

Guru Login Flow

If entered nickname equals a Guru User username:

Prompt for password

Prompt for 2FA

Load Guru’s stored nickname

Only the nickname shows publicly.

=============================
ROOM & MULTIPLAYER SYSTEM (REUSE UNO’S APPROACH)
=============================

Reuse QRFun’s UNO systems:

Room creation

Room join

WebSocket sync

Host system

Viewers

Promote viewer to player

Kick viewer

Spectator viewing

Restart flow

Restrictions

No host voting system

No difficulty selector in multiplayer

No takeover on disconnect

=============================
XO UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
=============================

XO must match QRFun’s quality standards.

Required:

Fully responsive

Turn highlighting

XO board animations (3×3 → 6×6)

Winning line highlight

Sound effects (toggle): move, win, draw, click

Smooth transition after QR join

Same styling principles as UNO

Not required:

Direction indicator

Guru aura

AI labels

=============================
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================
Backend

Node.js

Express

WebSockets (socket.io or ws)

Shared session management with UNO

TOTP 2FA

Email reset

Frontend

React (or QRFun frontend framework)

Shared UI components where possible

XO must live in its own module to avoid conflicts

AI Modules File Structure

Create:

xo-ai/minimax.js

xo-ai/mcts.js

xo-ai/ai-manager.js

Activates Normal Bot or Perfect Mode AI

Handles invisibility rule

=============================
FINAL OUTPUT
=============================

Deliver XO Multiplayer as a second game on the QRFun platform, with:

Full integration into main menu

Reuse of all existing systems (rooms, QR, WebSockets, admin, auth)

Zero impact on UNO game

Dynamic XO board progression

Perfect Mode AI & Normal Bot AI

Guru user login + 2FA

Email password reset

Nickname-only display

Host & viewer system

Smooth, production-ready UI

XO must become a polished, stable game inside QRFun, following the same development style and quality as the UNO Multiplayer game already built.
